Portfolio Artifact: Software Design Document â€“ The Gaming Room

Summary of the Client and Requirements

The Gaming Room is a company that offers a turn-based multiplayer game called Draw It or Lose It. 
The game was only available on Android at the time of the project. 
The client wanted to expand the game's accessibility across multiple platforms, including web browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices (iOS, Android), while ensuring seamless cross-platform gameplay. 
The primary objective was to develop a scalable, secure, and cost-effective web-based solution that ensures consistency and performance across all user devices.

What I Did Well

I identified and structured the system's technical requirements and constraints, outlining how to achieve platform compatibility, scalability, and security. 
I provided well-justified recommendations for the server environment, development tools, and architecture. 
My documentation effectively used comparative analysis and addressed both client-side and server-side needs comprehensively.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process

Working through the design document helped me gain a deep understanding of the architecture and strategic planning involved in software development. 
It encouraged me to break down the requirements, consider alternatives, and justify every major decision with a focus on real-world deployment. 
This planning step served as a roadmap, making the actual coding and implementation phase more manageable and focused on achieving specific goals.

What I Would Revise

If I were to revise any part of the document, I would expand on the user interaction and UI/UX planning for different platforms. 
While the technical infrastructure was well covered, a deeper look into the front-end experience, accessibility, and user flow would further enhance the design's completeness and clarity for developers working on the interface.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the client's business goals and the game's current limitations. 
By translating these needs into specific technical requirements, such as responsive design, seamless authentication, and secure data handling, I ensured that the design focused on user experience. 
Understanding and addressing user needs is critical because a product's success depends on functionality and how intuitive and reliable it feels to users.

Design Approach and Future Strategies

I approached the design using platform evaluations, risk assessments, and modular system planning. 
In the future, I would continue using a layered architecture approach, incorporate agile feedback loops, and create wireframes or prototypes early in the design stage. 
These strategies help align stakeholder expectations and streamline development from concept to deployment.
